# Fashion Forward: Personalized Recommendation System for H&M Customers


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->
*This project builds a personalized recommendation system to predict which fashion items users aged 20â€“40 are most likely to buy within the next 7 days, using transactional and product metadata from the H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations dataset on Kaggle as part of the AI4ALL program.*


## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

1. *Filtered and cleaned the H&M dataset*
2. *Created a working collaborative filtering model*
3. *Produced a working LSTM model with 80% accuracy*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
- *Understand user behavior, popular items, and purchase frequency.*

2. *Collaborative Filtering (Baseline)*
- *Matrix factorization*
- *Item-based and user-based similarity models* (e.g. Surprise, LightFM)*

3. *LSTM Recommender (Advanced)*
- *Sequence modeling of user transactions*
- *Learns purchase patterns over time*
- *Predicts next likely item(s) in the sequence*

4. Evaluation Metrics
- *Precision@K, Recall@K*
- *Hit Rate, MAP*
- *Diversity & Novelty*
